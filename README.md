## Introduction
This is a Travel Companion Application using Google Maps. It uses Geolocation, Google Maps API, Searching for places in order to fetch restaurants, hotels and attractions based on location from specialized Rapid APIs and data filtering.

I have used this project to develop my ability to fetch data from multiple API's, present this to the user in the most UX friendly way, and constantly update this based on the users input. Material UI is used throughout to help develop the application to a professional standard. 

Alongisde this I have increased my understanding of both folder structure within a React application and the use of React Hooks for both state and lifecycle purposes. 


Setup: run ```npm i && npm start``` to start the development server
